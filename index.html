		<p>Clash Royale is a tower rush video game which pits players in games featuring two or four players (1v1 or 2v2) in which the objective 
		is to destroy the most amount of opposing towers, with the destruction of the "King's Tower" being an instantaneous win.
		After three minutes, if both of the players or both of the teams have an equal amount of crowns or none at all the match continues 
		automatically onto overtime and the player who destroys an opposing tower wins instantaneously. After overtime, a draw occurs. 
		In a late 2018 update ditching the teammate in a 2v2 match multiple times caused the player to have a block that prevents him/her 
		from playing 2v2 with random players for a certain amount of time.
		</p>
		<p>In Clash Royale, players are ranked by their number of trophies. Players level up by gaining Experience (or King Level) points 
		through donating and upgrading cards. The highest possible level is level 13. The December 2018 Update added Star Points for excessive 
		Experience when players reach level 13, and will award Star Points for previously leftover Experience.
		</p>
		<p>Trophies are won or lost through multiplayer battles, a player wins a battle by destroying more towers than the 
		opponent (each destroyed tower being represented as a 'crown'), or by destroying the opponent's King's Tower, resulting in an automatic
		"three-crown" victory (unless the King's Tower was destroyed at the same time by both players, resulting in a draw).
		There are thirteen playing arenas in total (excluding the tutorial arena, Training Camp): Goblin Stadium, Bone Pit, 
		Barbarian Bowl, P.E.K.K.A's Playhouse, Spell Valley, Builder's Workshop, Royal Arena, Frozen Peak, Jungle Arena, Hog Mountain, 
		Electro Valley, Spooky Town, and Legendary Arena, with each arena corresponding to a certain trophy count range. 
		A player reaches leagues after reaching 4000 Trophies.
